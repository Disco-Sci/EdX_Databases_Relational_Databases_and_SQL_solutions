Question: 1
Problem: Find the names of all students who are friends with someone named Gabriel.
Solution: 

My strategy is to identify each ID within the relation/table 'friend' with it's correct name
The key used is highschooler ID
Making the cross product between all three relations I then filter match on key-value pairs
Lastly, the name associated with friend ID2 must be 'Gabriel'
From the resulting relation I select the name associated with friend - ID1

select hsID1.name
from friend, highschooler hsID1, highschooler hsID2
where friend.ID1 = hsID1.ID
and friend.ID2 = hsID2.ID
and hsID2.name = 'Gabriel'

Question: 2
Problem: For every student who likes someone 2 or more grades younger than themselves, return that student's name and grade, and the name and grade of the student they like.
Solution: 

select tbl1.name, tbl1.grade, tbl2.likes_name, tbl2.grade
from (
	select hs.ID, hs.name, hs.grade, likes.ID2
	from highschooler hs
	left join likes on hs.ID = likes.ID1
) tbl1
left join (
	select hs2.name likes_name, hs2.ID likes_ID, hs2.grade
	from highschooler hs2
	) tbl2 
	on tbl1.ID2 = tbl2.likes_ID
where likes_ID is not null and 
	tbl1.grade - tbl2.grade >= 2
  
select hs_1.name, hs_1.grade, hs_2.name, hs_2.grade
from likes, highschooler hs_1, highschooler hs_2
where likes.ID1 = hs_1.ID
and likes.ID2 = hs_2.ID 
and hs_1.grade - hs_2.grade >= 2

/*
Question: 3
Problem: For every pair of students who both like each other, return the name and grade of both students. Include each pair only once, with the two names in alphabetical order.
Solution: 

Select clause: 
ID1 name, ID1 grade, ID2 name, ID2 grade

From clause:
Cross product of like and highschooler relation/tables

Where clause:
Filter matching where 'likes' relation/tables attributes ID1 and ID2 are correlated to highschooler info
Filter matching where the inverse ID's are matching
Lastly where the ID1 name is seq. lower than ID2 name

Order by clause:
ID1 name, ID2 name

select hs_1.name, hs_1.grade, hs_2.name, hs_2.grade
from likes li_1, highschooler hs_1, highschooler hs_2, likes li_2
where li_1.ID1 = hs_1.ID
and li_1.ID2 = hs_2.ID
and hs_2.ID = li_2.ID1
and hs_1.ID = li_2.ID2
and hs_1.name < hs_2.name
order by hs_1.name, hs_2.name

Question: 4
Problem: Find all students who do not appear in the Likes table (as a student who likes or is liked) and return their names and grades. Sort by grade, then by name within each grade.
Solution: 

Select clause:
Return name and grade

From clause:
Highschooler relation/table

Where clause:
ID values that were in either likes.ID1 or likes.ID2

Order by: 
  Grade 
  Name

Script:

select name, grade

	select ID1
	from likes
	union
	select ID2
	from likes

/*
Question: 5
Problem: For every situation where student A likes student B, but we have no information about whom B likes (that is, B does not appear as an ID1 in the Likes table), return A and B's names and grades.
Solution: 

Select clause: 
Return ID1 name, ID1 grade, ID2 name, ID2 grade

From clause:
Cross product of three relations/tables
Match filtering 'likes' table attribute ID1 and ID2 to highschooler ID 
The result should be a relation that has corresponding info from highschooler for ID1 and ID2

Where clause:
A filter where tuples returned will have values of likes.ID2 that are not in likes.ID1

select hs_1.name, hs_1.grade, hs_2.name, hs_2.grade
from likes
join highschooler hs_1 on likes.ID1 = hs_1.ID
join highschooler hs_2 on likes.ID2 = hs_2.ID
where ID2 not in (
	select ID1
	from likes

/*
Question: 6
Problem: Find names and grades of students who only have friends in the same grade. Return the result sorted by grade, then by name within each grade.
Solution: 

script:
select distinct name, grade

	from friend
	where ID1 not in (
			select hs1.ID
			from ( 
				select f1.id1 F1_ID1, f1.id2 F1_ID2, f2.id1 F2_ID1, f2.id2 F2_ID2

			where hs1.grade != hs2.grade)
) tbl

Question: 7
Problem: 
Solution: 

An insane answer needs to be refactored but it works

select distinct hs1.name, hs1.grade, hs2.name, hs2.grade, hs3.name, hs3.grade
